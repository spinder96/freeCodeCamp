## Code Documentation

Code documentation is a way for developers to breifly, but accurately, describe their code in order to make their functions, variables, expressions, etc., as clear as possible to other developers. It also allows new developers to familiarize themselves with the customs of certain modules, functions, etc. of a particular programming language. It is always recommended that you write or read documentation before debugging yours or someone else's code, as this helps you to debug effectively and efficiently.

The most important aspects of documentation to remember while commenting your code are to clearly describe:
1. What your code does 
2. How your code does something
3. How your code should be used externally

For example, if you happen to pass your code along to an absolute beginner, they should be able to easily follow along through your comments in order to understand exactly what your variables mean and are what they are used for, and how your functions work to accomplish a specific goal.

It is extremely important to make a habit out of commenting your functions, loops, expressions, and declarations, and to treat comments as part of the source code, just as you treat the rest of your code.
